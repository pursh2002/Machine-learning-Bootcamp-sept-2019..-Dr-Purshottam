First, this is is the sentiment analyzer tool from this week's video 
https://github.com/shangeth/NLTK-Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis . When combined with 
this flask boilerplate login example, a working app for users can be made https://github.com/alectrocute/flaskSaaS

Homework

The homework for this week is to build 3 different types of regression lines to predict 
stock prices using Python, then print out the prediction for the best performing one.

Step 1 - Go to Yahoo Finance and find a stock price that you want to predict. Click on 
historical data, then download the CSV of that stocks price history https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/history?p=AAPL  

Step 2 - Use Scikit learn to try out 3 different types of regression models to predict the 
price of that stock for a future date. See this https://towardsdatascience.com/in-12-minutes-stocks-analysis-with-pandas-and-scikit-learn-a8d8a7b50ee7  as an example and the scikit learn docs to see all the different types of regression models you can easily build (i.e quadratic, linear, lasso, ridge, etc.)

Step 3 - Visualize your result using matplotlib or another plotting library of your choice

Once your code is complete, upload it to GitHub and send the github link to 
gradedhomeworkassignments@gmail.com with your full name as the subject line.  Good luck!
