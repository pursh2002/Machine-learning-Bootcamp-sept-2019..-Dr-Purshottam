# Your First Machine Learning Application 
- https://github.com/mtobeiyf/keras-flask-deploy-webapp

# Building Image classifier 
Demo - choose the image and upload e.g pandas - hit preditct (inference)

# Machine learning Pipe line 
1. Get the data any format
2. use python clean the data (data preperation, normaliasation, transformation , validation,feturization 
3. model bulding & trainging - feed to machine learning model( Hyperparameter tunning , automatic model selection, model testing,model validation 
4. model deployment - deployment , batch scoring
