CNN network well suided for Image data 
its sries of Filters this are matrices of number image goes through the network it splits into more and more filters ad network will learn the different parts and will classify the image based on predefined 
weather or not or yes disease, unsupurvised is anaother way to do that ... 
clustring - we can do th image classification on k mean he image data and the anomoly is the diseas 
automating alla the diseas , without data there is no machine learning 
-Biobert NLP is newer model th was trained on medical data questions and answers from pub med , reddit lnew data set 
we can create question and answer system , general doctor , used case speilty wise skin, medicne 
proof of concept, and then figure it out laws ....build and talk  tutorial are ther - pretrain nd train them 
automated software - chatbots we can use biobert
