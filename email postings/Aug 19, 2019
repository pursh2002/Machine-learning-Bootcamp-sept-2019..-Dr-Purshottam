I’m so excited to have you enrolled in Make Money with Machine Learning! Over the years, 
I've learned so much about the specific applications of this technology that 
can actually help one start a business or gain employment. 
I’ll be sharing it all with you during these 10 weeks. First things first, let’s get you prepared for week 1. 
Although the course is mainly in Python and Dart, which we’ll learn about, I’d like to give you this preparation 
material on HTML, CSS, and Javascript so you can build a solid foundation. 
Why? Because creating machine learning applications that people can actually use on the 
Web requires a little bit of knowledge on how to structure a web page (HTML), how to style a web page (CSS), 
and how to make it interactive (Javascript). As such, read - https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/introduction/#html-css-and-javascript 
this material to get up to speed. 
I’d also like you to do a little bit of Python practice as well. Read this(https://www.stavros.io/tutorials/python/) tutorial and watch this short 
playlist(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5pRlIbr6gg) I made to get up to speed on that. Week 1 content is released on August 25th, 
let’s build wealth and gain financial freedom with this incredible technology.
