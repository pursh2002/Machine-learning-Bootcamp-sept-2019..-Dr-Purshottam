# Stock price prediction using reinforcement learning 

colab 
# 
import dependencies 
import dataset(a bunch of stock price)
define our algorithims how we are going to make predection 
make those pedictions 

reinforcment - we create a agent that will lean in real enviroment 
stock market, real electric grid, 
data structure single array, neural network deep, data structure or algorithim 
stock market - buy sell 
game - go up or down 
electric - 
# this takes action inside the environemnt it recives two different variale 
- recive reward or new state of envi
familar with turing machine state 
state is numerical representation of of eviroment game - what level of are you 
energy - mount of energy consumption 
reward - a scaler value that is similar to state single number define wherate the action is performed  benificial what ever task
if benifical + 1 or not -1
reward and state guide the agent to make better learning 
through feed back loop 

# AI supper power chi fu 
apply AI ot finance 
agent - neural network feedforward , recurent network 
output  - net
